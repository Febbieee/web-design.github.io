                            <li><span>If you’re driving, you can easily find your way to Tops by
                     following the road signs from JY Square Mall in Lahug. The road leading to Tops is well-paved 
                     but can be narrow and winding, so exercise caution while driving. Motorcycle taxis,
                     known as habal-habal, are also available for hire if you prefer a more adventurous ride.</span></li>
                            <li><span>For those relying on public transportation, you can take a jeepney or taxi 
                    from Cebu City to JY Square Mall. From there, you can hire a motorcycle taxi or take another jeepney

                     Alternatively, visiting during sunset offers a different perspective, as the city lights begin 
                     to twinkle against the darkening sky.</span></li>
